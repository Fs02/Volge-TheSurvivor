1. adding generic events for less used event types (by event I mean things like onCollisionBegin, onDamage etc.)
	- Not to understand what do you mean, we'll talk about this later
2. Why do we have that RATIO constant in DebugDraw?
	- Just to avoiding include conflict
3. Problem with multiple inheritance - we cannot cast e.g. CHealth to IEntity and back easily. Should we stick with inheritance-based 
   component system or switch to aggregation based one?
4. Shouldn't CGun be part of CSoldier?
	
Just in case you need me, i'll probably available after 01:00 PM in your skype time
