1. adding generic events for less used event types (by event I mean things like onCollisionBegin, onDamage etc.)
	- Not to understand what do you mean, we'll talk about this later
2. Why do we have that RATIO constant in DebugDraw?
	- Just to avoiding include conflict
3. Problem with multiple inheritance - we cannot cast e.g. CHealth to IEntity and back easily. Should we stick with inheritance-based 
   component system or switch to aggregation based one?
   - in what case do we need to case CHealth to IEntity. yes we may if there isn't any other way
4. Shouldn't CGun be part of CSoldier?
	- CSoldier ? the AI Component or ??
	
5. The way transformable component work may conflict with how Box2D works, i'm planning to change setPosition with move and rotation with turn maybe, what do you think ?
7. Also, are you making the component to be general ?
8. if yes, we may need more than one constructor for physics component for each primitives(Box, Circle etc)
9. I think we should stickin b2Vec2 for gameplay aspect, it'll be better then using two vector, let's sf::vector2f only for engine usage
10.I will start working on this tonight(my time), i have assingment to finish before class
